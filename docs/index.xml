      <description>Why blog? Feel free to jump to the next section if you just want to learn how to use Hugo to set up a blog.
Writing helps me learn. Every time I want to learn a new technique, method or library I open up a sublime tab and type a lot. It helps me think, work through difficult logic and often helps pin point the source of difficulty. Writing in the form of journaling helps my mental health (I don&#39;t have a source for this, it just works for me).</description>

      <description>The bluethroat is a tiny, beautiful bird. I&#39;m not sure how and when I came across this bird but when I did, I couldn&#39;t stop thinking about it. I read everything I could about it, I looked at a million pictures online and even got a t-shirt painted with it. I was overjoyed to find that it winters in India and spent a considerable amount of time trying to track it down.</description>
