The bluethroat is a tiny, beautiful bird. I'm not sure how and when I came across this bird but when I did, I couldn't stop thinking about it. I read everything I could about it, I looked at a million pictures online and even got a t-shirt painted with it. I was overjoyed to find that it winters in India and spent a considerable amount of time trying to track it down. I chanced upon it late one evening on a walk with my *gujjar* guide in his village. It was busy foraging for insects. I had finally found my favorite bird, beautiful and dazzling, in a pile of dried cow poop amidst empty soda bottles.
