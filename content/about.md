The bluethroat is a tiny, beautiful bird. I'm not sure how and when I came across it but when I did, I couldn't stop thinking about it. I read everything I could about it, I looked at a million pictures online and even got a t-shirt painted with it. I was overjoyed to find that it winters in India and spent a considerable amount of time trying to track it down. I chanced upon it late one evening on a walk with my gujjar guide Taukeer *bhai*. We had 'finished' (you never really call it a day) our birding for the day and had a hearty meal. He asked me if I wanted to investigate a patch just outside his village for an elusive jungle fowl he thought he had heard. I obviously accepted. On our way to the patch we passed a non-descript piece of land, filled with cow dung and plastic bags. Taukeer *bhai* paused, listened keenly and then pointed towards movement on one pile of *gobar* (cow poop). There it was, my favorite bird - the bluethroat! It was busy foraging for insects. It was there, beautiful, stunning, pure, in a pile of dried *gobar* amidst empty soda bottles. 

Over and over again, birding has taught me that the best things in (birding) life are almost always buried deep in the everyday. Yes, there are rare mannikins deep in the amazon. Yes, you'll need to go to the northern mountains of Ethiopia to find a Lammergeier. But there's almost always birds around you that you know nothing about. On the wires by the road, outside your office building, at the sewerage works in the smelly part of town and in your *shamba* back home. You've just got to look and listen. Much like Taukeer *bhai* did.  

This blog is an attempt to take another look at the everyday work of a data analyst. To discover the beautiful in the normal, to search for intution rather than results and to find the bluethroat in the *gobar*.
